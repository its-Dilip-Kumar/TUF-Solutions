## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers **preorder** , which represents the preorder traversal of a BST (i.e., binary search tree), construct the tree and return its root.

It is guaranteed that it is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.

**Note** : As there can be many possible correct answers, the compiler outputs true if the solution is correct, else false.

### Example 1:

**Input:** preorder = [8, 5, 1, 7, 10, 12]

**Output:** [8, 5, 10, 1, 7, null, 12]

**Explanation:**

### Example 2:

**Input:** preorder = [1, 3]

**Output:** [1, null, 3]

**Explanation:**

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= preorder.length <= 100
- 1 <= preorder[i] <= 1000
- All the values of preorder are unique.
