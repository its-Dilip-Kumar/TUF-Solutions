## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a **mirror** of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

### Example 1:

**Input:** root = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

### Example 2:

**Input:** root = [1, 2, 2, null, 3, null, 3]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** When a straight line is drawn through the root node and the tree is folded around it, the rightmost node 3 is overlapped with null node and the node 3 present at left of root node is overlapped with null nodes.

So both node 3 in tree does not show symmetric behaviour.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1<= Number of Nodes <= 10^4
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
