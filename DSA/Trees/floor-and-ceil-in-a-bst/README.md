## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a **root** of binary search tree and a **key** (node) value, find the floor and ceil value for that particular key value.

- **Floor** Value Node: Node with the greatest data lesser than or equal to the key value.&nbsp;

- **Ceil** Value Node: Node with the smallest data larger than or equal to the key value.

If a particular floor or ceil value is not present then output -1.

### Example 1:

**Input:** root = [8, 4, 12, 2, 6, 10, 14] , key = 11

**Output:** [10, 12]

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= Number of Nodes <= 5000
- 1 <= Node.val <= 10^7
- 1 <= key <= 10^7
