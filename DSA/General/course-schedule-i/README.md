## 📝 Problem Statement

There are a total of N tasks, labeled from 0 to N-1. Given an array arr where arr[i] = [a, b] indicates that you must take course **b** first if you want to take course **a** . Find if it is possible to **finish** all tasks.

### Example 1:

**Input:** N = 4,&nbsp;arr = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,2]]

**Output:** True

**Explanation:** It is possible to finish all the tasks in the order : 0 1 2 3.

First, we will finish task 0. Then we will finish task 1, task 2, and task 3.

### Example 2:

**Input:** N = 4,&nbsp;arr = [[0,1],[3,2],[1,3],[3,0]]

**Output:** False

**Explanation:** It is impossible to finish all the tasks. Let’s analyze the pairs:

For pair {0, 1} -> we need to finish task 1 first and then task 0. (order : 1 0).

For pair{3, 2} -> we need to finish task 2 first and then task 3. (order: 2 3).

For pair {1, 3} -> we need to finish task 3 first and then task 1. (order: 3 1).

But for pair {3, 0} -> we need to finish task 0 first and then task 3 but task 0 requires task 1 and task 1 requires task 3. So, it is not possible to finish all the tasks.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- &nbsp;&nbsp;1 <= N <= 2000
- &nbsp;&nbsp;0 <= arr.length <= 5000
- &nbsp;&nbsp;arr[i].length == 2
- &nbsp;&nbsp;0 <= arr[i][0], arr[i][1] < N
- &nbsp;&nbsp;All the pairs arr[i] are unique.

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
