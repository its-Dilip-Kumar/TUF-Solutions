## 📝 Problem Statement

A line of **N** kids is standing there. The rating values listed in the integer array **ratings** are assigned to each kid.

These kids are receiving candy, according to the following criteria:

- There must be at least one candy for every child.

- Kids whose scores are higher than their neighbours receive more candies than their neighbours.

Return the **minimum** number of candies needed to distribute among children.

### Example 1:

**Input:** ratings = [1, 0, 5]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The distribution of candies will be 2 , 1 , 2 to first , second , third child respectively.

### Example 2:

**Input:** ratings = [1, 2, 2]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The distribution of candies will be 1 , 2 , 1 to first , second , third child respectively.

The third gets only 1 candy because it satisfy above two criteria.
