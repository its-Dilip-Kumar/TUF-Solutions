## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer&nbsp; **n,** return the first **n** (1-Indexed) rows of Pascal's **** triangle.

In&nbsp; **Pascal's triangle** :

- The&nbsp; **first** row has one element with a value of&nbsp; **1** .
- Each row has one more **** element in it than its&nbsp; **previous** row.
- The value of each element is equal **** to the sum **** of the elements directly **** above it when arranged in a triangle format.

### Example 1:

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1]]

**Explanation:** The Pascal's Triangle is as follows:

1

1 1

1 2 1

1 3 3 1

1st Row has its value set to 1.

All other cells take their value as the sum of the values directly above them

### Example 2:

**Input:** n = 5

**Output:** [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

**Explanation:** The Pascal's Triangle is as follows:

1

1 1

1 2 1

1 3 3 1

1 4 6 4 1

1st Row has its value set to 1.

All other cells take their value as the sum of the values directly above them

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 30
- All values will fit inside a 32-bit integer.
