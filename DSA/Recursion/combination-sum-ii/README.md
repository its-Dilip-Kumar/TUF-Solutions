## 📝 Problem Statement

Given collection of candidate numbers (candidates) and a integer target *.* Find all **unique combinations** in candidates where the sum is equal to the target.There can only be **one** **usage** of each number in the candidates combination and return the answer in **sorted** order.

e.g : The combination [1, 1, 2] and [1, 2, 1] are not unique.

### Example 1:

**Input:** candidates = [2, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5] , target = 8

**Output:** &nbsp;[ [1, 1, 6] , [1, 2, 5] , [1, 7] , [2, 6] ]

**Explanation:** The combinations sum up to target are

1 + 1 + 6 => 8.

1 + 2 + 5 => 8.

1 + 7 => 8.

2 + 6 => 8.

### Example 2:

**Input:** candidates = [2, 5, 2, 1, 2] , target = 5

**Output:** &nbsp;[ [1, 2, 2] , [5] ]

**Explanation:** The combinations sum up to target are

1 + 2 + 2 => 5.

5 => 5.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= candidates.length <= 100
- 1 <= candidates[i] <= 50
- 1 <= target <= 30
