## 📝 Problem Statement

Given one meeting room and N meetings represented by two arrays, start and end, where start[i] represents the start time of the ith meeting and end[i] represents the end time of the ith meeting, determine the **maximum** number of meetings that can be accommodated in the meeting room if only one meeting can be held at a time. A meeting starting at the same time another meeting ends is considered overlapping.

### Example 1:

**Input:** Start = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5]&nbsp;,&nbsp;End = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The meetings that can be accommodated in meeting room are (1,2) , (3,4) , (5,7) , (8,9).

### Example 2:

**Input:** Start = [10, 12, 20]&nbsp;,&nbsp;End = [20, 25, 30]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Given the start and end time, only one meeting can be held in meeting room.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 10^5
- 0 <= start[i] < end[i] <= 10^5

## 💡 Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(N)$
- **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$
