## 📝 Problem Statement

The beauty of a string is defined as the **difference** between the **frequency** of the **most frequent** character and the **least frequent** character **(excluding characters that do not appear)** in that string.

Given a string s, return the **sum of** **beauty** values of **all possible substrings** of s.

### Example 1:

**Input:** s = "xyx"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The substrings with non-zero beauty are:

- "xyx" → frequencies: x:2, y:1 → beauty = 2 - 1 = 1

- "xy" → x:1, y:1 → beauty = 0

- "yx" → y:1, x:1 → beauty = 0

- "x" or "y" → beauty = 0

Total sum = 1 (from "xyx") = 1

### Example 2:

**Input:** s = "aabcbaa"

**Output:** 17

**Explanation:** Various substrings such as "aabc", "bcba", etc., have non-zero beauty values. Summing all gives 17.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- 1 <= s.length <= 500
- s consists of only lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z')
