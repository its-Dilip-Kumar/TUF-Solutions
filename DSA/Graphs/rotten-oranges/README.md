## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an n x m grid, where each cell has the following values :&nbsp;

2&nbsp;-&nbsp;represents a rotten orange

1&nbsp;-&nbsp;represents a Fresh orange

0&nbsp;-&nbsp;represents an Empty Cell

Every minute, if a fresh orange is adjacent to a rotten orange in **4-direction** ( upward, downwards, right, and left ) it becomes rotten.&nbsp;

Return the **minimum** number of **minutes** required such that none of the cells has a Fresh Orange. If it's not possible, return -1.

### Example 1:

**Input:** grid = [ [2, 1, 1] , [0, 1, 1] , [1, 0, 1] ]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** &nbsp;Orange at (3,0) cannot be rotten.
