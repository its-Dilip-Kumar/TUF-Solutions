## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the heads **** of two linked lists A and B, containing positive integers. Find the node at which the two linked lists **intersect** . If they do intersect, return the node **** at which the intersection begins, otherwise return null.

The Linked List will not **** contain any cycles. The linked lists must retain **** their original **** structure, given as per the input, after **** the function returns.

**Note** : for custom input, the following parameters are required(your program is not **** provided with these parameters):

- **intersectVal** - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is -1 if there is no intersected node.
- **skipA** - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node( **-1** if no intersection).
- **skipB** - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node( **-1** if no intersection).
- **listA** - The first linked list.
- **listB** - The second linked list.

### Example 1:

**Input:** listA: intersectVal = 4, skipA = 3, skipB = 2, head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, listB: head -> 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5

<img src="https://static.takeuforward.org/content/ProblemSetter-9Sg1d-Lo">

**Output:** (value at returned node is displayed): 4

**Explanation:** The two lists have nodes with values 4 and 5 as their tails.

### Example 2:

**Input:** listA: intersectVal = -1, skipA = -1, skipB = -1, head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3, listB: head -> 8 -> 9

<img src="https://static.takeuforward.org/content/ProblemSetter-p32uBGcT">

**Output:** (value at returned node is displayed): null

**Explanation:** The two lists do not intersect.

Still unsure what the problem is asking ?

Let’s go through a few more examples, step by step, to make it clearer.

### Constraints

- m == number of nodes in listA.
- n == number of nodes in listB.
- 1 <= m, n <= 5 * 10^4
- 0 <= ListNode.val <= 10^4
- 0 <= skipA < m
- 0 <= skipB < n
- intersectVal, skipA, skipB is -1 if listA and listB do not intersect.
- intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect.
